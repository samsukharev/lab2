Specify and implement an ADT character string by using a linked chain of characters. Include typical operations such as finding its length, appendeing one string to another, finding the index of the leftmost occurence of a character in a string, and testing whether a string is a substring of another.

Program must compile and run.
Create an ADT character string (linked_char is name I am using) by using a linked list of characters
Main function will have a menu of options.
Enter new string and store as linked list of characters in an ADT linked_char class
Get current length (number of characters stored) from linked_char 
Append a linked_char to another linked_char
